# Done

The import script should first look at all files being imported and take the last start date (newest) of all the transaction files (eg/ if one starts on feb 1. 2021 and another starts on mar. 1 2022 then it would take mar. 1 2022) then it uses that as a cutoff meaning it does not import any transactions before that date

Add amount range filter to search

In reports:

    * targets

        * when first showing targets and selecting defaults it should do so such that fixed / and guilt free have $0 surplus, investments are 10% and short term savings is remainder from 100% with either surplus or defecit

---

In transactions filter there should be a toggle 'hide net zero' - the button has a tooltip explaining what it does.

    * enabling it goes through the transactions lits and if there are pairs of transactions where one is the exact same amount as the other but one is inflow and the other is outflow then exclude them
