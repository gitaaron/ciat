# Transaction Labels

### Overview

Transaction labels provide a way to group transactions besides the standard four categories.

Labels can later be used for reporting and search purposes (eg/ providing a line chart of monthly spending by label).

### Functional Requirements

When creating or editing rules, it should be possible to include an optional label.

When a rule is applied to a transaction it then applies the category along with the label.
