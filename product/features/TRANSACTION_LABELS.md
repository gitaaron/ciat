# Transaction Labels

### Overview

Transaction labels provide a way to group transactions besides the standard four categories.

Labels can later be used for reporting and search purposes (eg/ providing a line chart of monthly spending by label).

### Functional Requirements

When creating or editing rules, it should be possible to include an optional label.

When a rule is applied to a transaction it then applies the category along with the label.

Any time I can edit or create the rule (including during the import transactions flow) I should also be able to add a label.

When adding the label to a rule, it should be a search for previously created labels or a button to create a new one based on what i've entered in the text box.

I should be able to add more than one label to each rule.

I should also be able to remove labels from the rule.

### Automatic Labels

(No automatic labels are currently applied during import.)
