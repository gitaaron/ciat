# Make Instructions

This folder contains all requirements for this project.  Read through them and create the project accordingly.

> Provide a bundle so the entire project can be downloaded at once and a git repo can be created from it.

> If you’re implementing or generating code, start with the relevant file in `features/` and follow the cross‑links for related parts of the system.

> Tip: Keep generated bundles small (exclude the live SQLite DB file; include schema/migrations and any seed data instead).
