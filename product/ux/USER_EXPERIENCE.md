# User Experience

### Empty State

- If transactions are empty:
  - **Hide the Transactions tab**.
  - **Open to the Import tab** by default.
  - Show the message: “**Get started by importing transactions**.” (Only when no transactions have ever been imported.)

### Title
- Use the full title **“Can I Afford That”** at the top of the page (not the acronym).
