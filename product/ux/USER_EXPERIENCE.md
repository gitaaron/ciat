# User Experience

### Empty State

- If transactions are empty:
  - **Hide the Transactions tab**.
  - **Open to the Import tab** by default.
  - Show the message: “**Get started by importing transactions**.” (Only when no transactions have ever been imported.)

### Title
- Use the full title **“Can I Afford That”** at the top of the page (not the acronym).
- a wallet icon (mdi-wallet) should appear right before the title; there the same amount of padding on each side of it

### Top Level Tabs

The top level tabs should be:

    * transactions

    * reports

    * manage rules
        * new category rule can be opened from this tab

    * import

Note: database versions can be opened from a settings icon in the top level app bar

Note: tabs should be hidden if there have not been any transactions imported yet
