# Architecture

## Backend

* node/express

* separate API ran through `npm run api`

## Data

* sqlite

    * sqlite file generated by application should be ignored in .gitignore but versioned by another means so that I can revert to a previous version

    * watch for changes on DB (kicked off from `npm run dev`) and version it

    * cli interface for listing previous versions of db and reverting to a previous version

## Frontend

* vite/vuejs

* d3.js for visualizing (eg/ charts)
