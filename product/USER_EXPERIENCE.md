# User Experience

* if transactions are empty then:
    * hide the transactions tab and the application show open to the import tab first
    * a message saying 'get started by importing transactions' should be displayed (this should only be displayed if there have not already been transactions imported)

* the title should be read the full 'Can I Afford That' at the top of the page (not the acronym)
