# CIAT — Can I Afford That

Welcome! **CIAT** is a family budgeting app inspired by Ramit Sethi’s “I Will Teach You To Be Rich”.

It helps you categorize spending into four buckets — **Guilt Free**, **Short‑Term Savings**, **Fixed Costs**, and **Investments** — and visualize where your money goes over time.

This folder contains a set of docs for humans and AI code tools.

## The four categories

- **Guilt Free** — Discretionary spending that you intentionally allow.
- **Short‑Term Savings** — One off expenses or near‑term goals.
- **Fixed Costs** — Recurring obligations (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.).
- **Investments** — Retirement and long‑term wealth building.

Happy building!
