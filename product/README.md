# CIAT — Can I Afford That

Welcome! **CIAT** is a family budgeting app inspired by Ramit Sethi’s “I Will Teach You To Be Rich”.

It helps you categorize spending into four main buckets — **Guilt Free**, **Short‑Term Savings**, **Fixed Costs**, and **Investments** — and visualize where your money goes over time. The system also supports a **Transfer** category for manually categorizing transfers between accounts (excluded from reports).

This folder contains a set of docs for humans and AI code tools.

## The four main categories

- **Guilt Free** — Discretionary spending that you intentionally allow.
- **Short‑Term Savings** — One off expenses or near‑term goals.
- **Fixed Costs** — Recurring obligations (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.).
- **Investments** — Retirement and long‑term wealth building.

**Additional category:**
- **Transfer** — Manually set category for transfers between accounts. This category is excluded from all reports (pie charts, line charts, category targets) but can be viewed and filtered in the Transactions tab. Transfer category is never auto-generated by rules.
